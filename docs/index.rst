Pydifact documentation
======================

Pydifact is a library that aims to provide complete support for reading and
writing `EDIFACT <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIFACT>`_ files.
These file format, despite being old, is still a standard in many business cases.
In Austria e.g., it is used for the transfer of medical reports between medical doctors.

This documentation ATM just contains the API as a starting point.
