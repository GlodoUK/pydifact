Contributing
============

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project.

Rules are easy. You can

* Write an issue - if you find something like a problem. The more exact, the better.
* Write documentation - that's when you already know the code a bit.
* Write code - maybe you need a feature pydifact isn't capable of? Add it and make a PR.

Writing code
------------

All files must be formatted using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io). Easier is not possible.
For bigger features it is recommended to create an own branch.
