## pydifact - A Python EDIFACT library


#### Preamble

This is a port of [metroplex-systems/edifact](https://github.com/metroplex-systems/edifact) to Python. Thanks here at the start to [Craig Duncan](https://github.com/duncan3dc) for this cool piece of software. Porting was like a breeze due to the high code quality there. All credits for the initial code here go to him, I just did the translation to Python 3.

#### Why another EDIFACT library?

Because I did not find a decent UN/EDIFACT library for Python, so I decided to port one of the available good PHP libraries to Python. Here is the result.

ATM this is a work In Progress, feel free to help. The state is pre-alpha.
